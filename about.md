Greetings,

My name is Brian Goldman and I am a software engineer at Google in Boulder, Colorado.
I received my Ph.D. for work developing better generic search algorithms.
I published all of my research code on [Github](https://github.com/brianwgoldman), and you can find links to all of my papers on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bfwfGycAAAAJ&hl=en).
