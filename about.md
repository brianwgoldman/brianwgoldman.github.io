Greetings,

My name is Brian Goldman and I am a Ph. D. student in the Computer Science and Engineering department
of Michigan State University. My research focuses on developing better generic search algorithms.
I publish all of my research code on [Github](https://github.com/brianwgoldman), and you can find links to all of my papers on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bfwfGycAAAAJ&hl=en).

### Research Specifics

My thesis work is related to the development and analysis of the "Parameter-less Population Pyramid" or P3 for short.
P3 is an algorithm I designed which attempts to find high quality solutions to a wide range of problems.
