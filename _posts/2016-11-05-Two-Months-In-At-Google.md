title: Two Months In at Google
---
Back in early September I started working for Google in Boulder, Colorado. This was quite the switch for me
as I'd always assumed I would stay in academia. But they made me an offer I couldn't refuse, and with Alice
turning 5 months old this week its nice to have that extra income and a 9 to 5 job.

Google deserves its reputation as a great place to work. The food is great (free breakfast and lunch),
the people are genuinely interested in doing things right, and the atmosphere is very relaxed. I mean,
there is a 6 foot tall Velociraptor next to my desk.

The project I'm working on is not what I expected when I accepted the offer, but with so much to learn
and do I've been relatively happy. One frustrating bit has been the rather slow process of getting
approval to continue work on outside research, but I hope that will be resolved in the next week or two.
