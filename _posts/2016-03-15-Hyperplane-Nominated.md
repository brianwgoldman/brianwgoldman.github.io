title: Hyperplane Elimination Nominated Best Paper at EvoCOP
---
My nomination streak continues, this time at the
[European Conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimisation (EvoCOP)](http://www.evostar.org/2016/cfp_evocop.php).
My paper is titled [Hyperplane Elimination for Quickly Enumerating Local Optima](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-30698-8_11).
The basic idea is that for certain types of problems, it is possible to determine that large portions of the search space
cannot contain any local optima. As a result, Hyperplane elimination was able to find all local optima of landscapes
that would take previous methods an estimated 900 million years to complete in just 6 minutes.
