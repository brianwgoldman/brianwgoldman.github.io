title: P3 now in HeuristicLab

[HeuristicLab](http://dev.heuristiclab.com/trac.fcgi/wiki) is an open source toolkit for performing optimization.
Developed by the [Heuristic and Evolutionary Algorithms Laboratory (HEAL)](http://heal.heuristiclab.com/), user friendly software
provides a clean graphical interface and a heap of features. I am excited to announce that P3 is now
[available for download](http://dev.heuristiclab.com/trac.fcgi/wiki/Download) as part of HeuristicLab 3.3.11.

HeuristicLab ships with an extensive library of optimization algorithms, most of which focus on solving symbolic regression tasks.
It also comes with some nice built in data analysis tools such as real time graphing.
